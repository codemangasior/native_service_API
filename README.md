# NativeService API
API for handling files and custom forms of NativeService.

# What is NativeService?
NativeService API is a business tool for a growing startup based on translations and profiled services. The main 
assumption of NS is to deliver 'product' to the customer as fast as they need it with minimize requirements for 
customers. The main motto of NS is "Get it done with a couple of clicks from home".

# How does it work?
The simplest way to tell you how it works will be splitting the procedure into the few steps.

So when the customer is decided to go into cooperation with us, all he needs to do is: 
1) make choose one of four our categories,
2) fill the simple form on which we base while pricing,
3) just wait **15 minutes** for the response of our language speaker,
4) accept our conditions and price,
5) make payment by online transfer on our API's page,
6) take back by the email prepared by us a document or another service.

# What's next?
All the logic of NS software is based on emails for now. Very soon we will implement the new feature which lets NS 
support all orders by custom admin panel. Right now software is ready for low customer traffic. Admin panel will improve 
NS abilities to support high customer traffic.
